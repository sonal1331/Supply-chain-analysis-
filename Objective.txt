We want to generate some interesting insights from ship movement data using AI/ML algorithms.
We have historical ship logbook data for a century - from 1750-1850 - opened and digitized by EU. Have a look at reference links.

Some basic insights we can derive are:

1. What are most used routes across the globe? 

    - Season wise

    - Country wise

    - Year wise


2. How many times 2 ships came closer to each other and breached distance separation?

    - Can we gather stats on such breaches countrywise, year-wise etc.? What algorithm we should use for finding proximity given a geo-fence value?

    - Can we predict pirate/evil ships from this stat?

3. If we use this as training set, can we predict probability of pirate attacks on some routes?

4. Can we found any other anomaly or outliers like ships not taking preferred route etc.

The canvas is wide open here. So feel free to come up with ideas on what else we can do with this data.
Keep in mind that our customer will be merchant navy and government security agencies. So the insights should be meaningful for them.
